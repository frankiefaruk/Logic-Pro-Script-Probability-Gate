**Here's a breakdown of the code and how it works:**

**Parameter Definitions:**

* **High Note:** Sets the maximum MIDI note value.
* **Low Note:** Sets the minimum MIDI note value.
* **Probability:** Determines the chance of a note being sent, expressed as a percentage.

**Event Handling:**

1. **Note Filtering:**
   - Checks if the incoming MIDI note's pitch is within the specified range.
   - If the note is outside the range, an "all notes off" message is sent to prevent unintended sounds.
2. **Probability Check:**
   - Uses a random number generator to determine if the note should be sent based on the `probability` parameter.
   - If the random number is less than or equal to the `probability`, the note is sent.
3. **Event Sending:**
   - If the note passes both the range and probability checks, it's sent to the output.

**Key Points:**

* **Randomness:** The `eventShouldSend()` function introduces randomness by generating a random number between 1 and 100. If this number is less than or equal to the `probability` setting, the note is sent.
* **Flexibility:** By adjusting the `High Note`, `Low Note`, and `Probability` parameters, you can create a wide range of effects, from subtle randomization to extreme filtering.
* **Efficiency:** The code is optimized for performance, ensuring smooth processing of MIDI data.

**Additional Tips:**

* Experiment with different probability settings to achieve various levels of randomness and filtering.
* Combine this script with other MIDI effects to create complex and interesting sound transformations.
* Consider using this script to create unique rhythmic patterns and melodic variations.
